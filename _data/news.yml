  - Feature research influenced by biodiversity data and its impact on the US.
  - Promote upcoming events.
  - Present the latest news tailored to your chosen topics.
  
  **For multilingual sites, remember to:**
  - Add necessary translations for DataUse, News, Event, and Literature in [`_data/translations.yml`](https://github.com/gbif/jekyll-theme-algae/blob/master/_data/translations.yml).
  - Specify the desired language code for the stories block under `storiesLocale` in [`_data/languages.yml`](https://github.com/gbif/jekyll-theme-algae/blob/master/_data/languages.yml).
