The U.S. Geological Survey recently published the Hawaii portion of the checklist dataset, the United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS). The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species – Hawaii, United Statesincludes 6,069 names, of which 51% are insects (Class Insecta) and 29% are dicotyledonous plants (Class Magnoliopsida). The image above, of the invasive Southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, has widely transmitted avipox virus in Hawaii, endangering native bird species.

Two more checklists that are included in the United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species are: the recently published Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Alaska, United States and V2.0 of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - United States of America (Contiguous), which is also expected to be published shortly.
