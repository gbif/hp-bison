The U.S. Geological Survey recently published the Hawaii portion of the checklist dataset, the United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS). The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species – Hawaii, United States, includes 6,069 names, of which 51% are insects (Class Insecta) and 29% are dicotyledonous plants (Class Magnoliopsida). The image above, of the invasive Southern house mosquito, *Culex quinquefasciatus*, has widely transmitted avipox virus in Hawaii, endangering native bird species.

Two more checklists that are included in the United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species are: the recently published Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Alaska, United States, and V2.0 of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - United States of America (Contiguous), which is also expected to be published shortly.
