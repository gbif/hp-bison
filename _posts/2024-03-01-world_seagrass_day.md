Happy World Seagrass Day GBIF-US community! You may be wondering what makes seagrass worth celebrating. Well, seagrass isn't just a type of plant, but also a valued ecosystem for a number of reasons: it provides extensive habitat and food for fish, invertebrates, epiphytic algae and microbes; it helps sequester carbon; it provides forage for rare and endangered species, including manatees and sea turtles; it improves water quality and stabilizes the sediment, helping to protect coastal zones and reefs from wave damage and erosion [(Mtwana et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163091). 

Unfortunately, even though we understand how important seagrasses are, there is a global decline in seagrass populations. The scientific community has called for ongoing assessments of the status of seagrass populations to help us understand the factors that may be contributing to this decline [(Waycott et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0905620106 ). GBIF-US can help by coordinating these assessments in a central location, and in a standardized format. 

Although we don't have every single seagrass dataset out there, there are over xx seagrass datasets (observations might be a better metric) published to GBIF representing xx species. These datasets have been cited by XX peer-reviewed publications, but we think we can do better.  We have been in conversation with [seagrassnet.org](https://www.seagrassnet.org/), to help them share their data through GBIF and OBIS, in addition to their own portal.  If you know of other datasets that we could help mobilize, please reach out to us at gbif-us@usgs.gov, or you can suggest the dataset via the GBIF 'suggest a dataset' tool.
