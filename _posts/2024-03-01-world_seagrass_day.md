Happy World Seagrass Day, GBIF-US community! [World Seagrass Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/seagrass-day) was created by the UN General Assembly in 2022 to raise awareness for the conservation of seagrasses. You may be wondering what makes seagrass worth celebrating? 

##### Why?
Well, seagrass isn't just a type of plant, but also a valued ecosystem for a number of reasons: it provides extensive habitat and food for fish, invertebrates, epiphytic algae and microbes; it helps sequester carbon; it provides forage for rare and endangered species, including manatees and sea turtles; it improves water quality and stabilizes the sediment, helping to protect coastal zones and reefs from wave damage and erosion [(Mtwana et al., 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163091). 

Unfortunately, even though we understand how important seagrasses are, there is a global decline in seagrass populations. The scientific community has called for ongoing assessments of the status of seagrass populations to help us understand the factors that may be contributing to this decline [(Waycott et al., 2009)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0905620106 ). GBIF-US can help by coordinating these assessments in a central location, and in a standardized format. 

##### What data do we have?
Although we don't have every single seagrass dataset out there, there are over [300,000 seagrass seagrass occurrences published to GBIF]((https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/charts?taxon_key=2863960&taxon_key=2864083&taxon_key=2864082&taxon_key=2863952&taxon_key=2866112&taxon_key=2866030&taxon_key=2768016&taxon_key=2864050&taxon_key=2864092&taxon_key=2864073&taxon_key=2864085&occurrence_status=present)), representing [74 species](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/taxonomy?taxon_key=2863960&taxon_key=2864083&taxon_key=2864082&taxon_key=2863952&taxon_key=2866112&taxon_key=2866030&taxon_key=2768016&taxon_key=2864050&taxon_key=2864092&taxon_key=2864073&taxon_key=2864085&occurrence_status=present)\*. These data were contributed from 177 datasets and 106 publishers. Data from the [United States includes over 23,000 of those occurrences and represents 30 species](https://www.gbif.us/data/?occurrenceStatus=PRESENT&taxonKey=2863960&taxonKey=2864083&taxonKey=2864082&taxonKey=2863952&taxonKey=2866112&taxonKey=2866030&taxonKey=2768016&taxonKey=2864050&taxonKey=2864092&taxonKey=2864073&taxonKey=2864085&view=TABLE) But we think we can do better. If you know of other datasets that we could help mobilize, please reach out to us at gbif-us@usgs.gov, or you can suggest the dataset via the GBIF ['suggest a dataset' tool](https://www.gbif.org/suggest-dataset).
