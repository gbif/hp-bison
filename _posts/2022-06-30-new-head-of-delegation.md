The United States delegation to GBIF has a new Head of Delegation. Dr. Roland Roberts, National Science Foundation (NSF), served five years as the U.S. Head of Delegation and has taken on a new position at NSF as Deputy Chief Officer for Research Facilities. The new Head of Delegation for the U.S. is Dr. Simon Malcomber Deputy Assistant Director for the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences. Dr. Malcomber began this role in March 2022. Dr. Roberts adeptly navigated the U.S. Delegation through several opportunities and challenges including increased sharing of species occurrences and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We would like to thank Dr. Roberts for his leadership and welcome Dr. Malcomber to this role.
