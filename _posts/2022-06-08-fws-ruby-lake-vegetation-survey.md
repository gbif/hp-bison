The [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/science-analytics-and-synthesis-sas) has published to GBIF, on behalf of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a [vegetation mapping survey](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b1c0c801-1758-408d-aebd-777cbc1dfac7). This survey, carried out in collaboration with University of Nevada - Reno in 2012-2013, includes the locations of 577 plants from 54 unique taxa. [Ruby Lake National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ruby-lake) is located in northeast Nevada. To the west of the Refuge are the Ruby Mountains and Ruby Lake lies to the north. This is one of the most remote National Wildlife Refuges in the lower 48 states, and it encompasses more than 150 km2 of wetlands.
