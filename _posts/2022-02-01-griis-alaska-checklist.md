The U.S. Geological Survey recently published the Alaska portion of the checklist dataset, the United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (US-RIIS), called the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species – Alaska, United States. This Alaska checklist includes 532 introduced and invasive species names, of which 71% are dicotyledenous plants (Class Magnoliopsida), and 13% insects (Class Insecta). Also, 68% of the names on this checklist are invasive species, defined as non-native species that cause, or are likely to cause, harm. 

Two more checklists that are included in the United States Register of Introduced and Invasive Species are also expected to be published shortly: the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species – Hawaii, United States, and V2.0 of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - United States of America (Contiguous).
