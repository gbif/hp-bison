BISON recently published the 2005 version of the [New York City Street Tree Census](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/c4e1739b-e225-4773-b2ca-b9dd90846c62). This dataset includes citywide street tree data from the 2005 NYC Street Tree Census. This census has been conducted every 10 years since 1995, partly by volunteers, and organized by NYC Parks & Recreation. Trees were inventoried by address, and data were collected between 2005 and 2006. The information collected includes more than half a million records about 165 different tree species, their diameter, and condition.
