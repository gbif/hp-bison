Some changes are happening on the GBIF-US staff! [Abby Benson](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/abby-benson), the long-time node manager of GBIF-US, has begun a 2-year detail (AKA secondment) with the [U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)](https://www.globalchange.gov/) and will be working on the [U.S. National Nature Assessment](https://www.globalchange.gov/our-work/national-nature-assessment). Please join us in congratulating Abby on her new role! While we will miss her, we can't think of a better person to help guide such an important effort.  

Abby has kindly agreed to continue participating as a [GBIF-US delegate](https://www.gbif.org/country/US/summary), allowing us to lean on her experience, and helping to connect GBIF to her new work.

[Steve Formel](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/stephen-k-formel) is stepping in to fill Abby's shoes as node manager.  Steve has been GBIF-US node staff for the past year, and is excited to continue collaborating with the [GBIF network](https://www.gbif.org/what-is-gbif) to facilitate biodiversity science.
