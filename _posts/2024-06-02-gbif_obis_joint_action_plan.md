GBIF and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) have agreed to a joint strategy and action plan that will deepen their collaboration, improve the flows and services of high-quality data about marine and coastal biodiversity, and support research and decision-making on the world's oceans.  We're particularly excited about this because we manage the US nodes for both networks!  We were happy to participate in developing this aagreement, and feel that it is going to drive the work we do, and the services we deliver, to be more efficient and useful for the communities we serve.
