We're excited to announce the publication of the dataset, "[Statewide Alaska Tern Occurrences](https://doi.org/10.15468/7mzh97)" (Moore et al. 2024)! We worked with Liz Moore, a landscape ecologist from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), to publish this data to [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/2e197e5f-d3d1-48b2-bd86-293df47b0a46) and [OBIS](https://obis.org/dataset/9c3e1803-61db-48fb-94fd-24ea5a17ba8b). 

However, a dozen other scientists from the USFWS, U.S. Forest Service, McDonald Data Sciences, National Audubon Society, Oregon State University, and Tern Again Consulting also contributed. The data includes 895 records of Aleutian and Arctic terns and is a compilation of tern colony locations known in Alaska. The primary purpose was to create a habitat model to inform future field work in 2024 and 2025. The model report is being revised now and will be linked to the data when ready.
