GBIF has announced its [call for nominations for the 2025 GBIF Graduate Researchers Award](https://www.gbif.org/news/4AAE2KOKBRJ0iS2DE2fT65/call-for-nominations-opens-for-2025-gbif-graduate-researchers-award). Share how you're using open biodiversity data from the GBIF network in your graduate research—you could **earn global recognition and €5,000!**
The deadline for US applications is **May 27, 2025**. This award is aimed at graduate students whose master’s and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data. 

#### Important Details

- The US node staff, with help from the US science community, will nominate one master’s and one PhD candidate to the GBIF Secretariat.
- The GBIF Secretariat will announce winners prior to the 32nd meeting of the GBIF Governing Board (GB32), on 18-20 October 2025 in Bogotá, Colombia, and present their work at that meeting.

**Eligibility**

- Candidates must provide a letter of support verifying their affiliation with a university graduate programme (as a currently enrolled master's, PhD, or post-doctoral student) to be eligible for the award. In addition, candidates must be either:

	- a) citizens of a country participating in GBIF or
    - b) students at an institution located in a GBIF participant country.

Nominations can come from the GBIF delegation or node of either the candidate's country of citizenship or the country of the candidate’s host institution.
