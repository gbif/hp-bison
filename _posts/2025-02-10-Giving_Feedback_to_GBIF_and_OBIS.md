Have you ever come across data in GBIF or OBIS and wanted to alert the provider that some detail needed revising? In short, it's as easy as clicking a button! But it's also the kind of button you might now see until someone points it out to you. Our friends over at the [SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal](https://www.biodiversity.aq/) were kind enough to point it out, along with some excellent pointers on providing useful feedback.  You can read their post here: [https://www.biodiversity.aq/post/2025/how-to-feedback-gbif-obis/](https://www.biodiversity.aq/post/2025/how-to-feedback-gbif-obis/)
