The [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/science-analytics-and-synthesis-sas) has published to GBIF, on behalf of Utah Division of Water Quality and the Colorado Water Quality Control Division, a [freshwater mollusk survey](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/63f086f6-1ce8-4338-a25d-7d298cfa2789). Although the results of the commissioned survey has an emphasis on ammonia-sensitive freshwater mussels (Superfamily Unionoidea) and non-pulmonate snails (Valvatidae, Hydrobiidae), non-native mollusks that were encountered are also included. The temporal scope of the dataset is 1871-2016 and includes historic museum and recently surveyed records.
