In 1995, hundreds of volunteers joined the New York City (NYC) Department of Parks & Recreation staff, with support from the US Forest Service, to inventory the city's street tree population. These inventory efforts resulted in an unprecedented understanding of NYCâ€™s urban forest, and catalyzed major advances in its urban forest management. With 516,989 records for 263 unique taxa, the dataset, recently published to GBIF by USGS, paved the way for two subsequent inventories, which are undertaken every ten years.
