BISON is a web-based, all-species mapping resource for finding and accessing occurrence records of species found in the United States. BISON is one of the major data aggregators for species occurrence data in the U.S. compiling and standardizing species occurrence data from multiple data providers. BISON is hosted by the [Science Analytics and Synthesis Program (SAS)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis), a USGS program whose mission, in part, is to provide biodiversity information to serve our Nation. SAS accomplishes this mission by providing bioinformatic tools, data and models for biological researchers, government decision-makers and other stakeholders. USGS also hosts the U.S. Node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).
