This folder is only available in your UAT and STAGING environment. 
It can be used for you to save examples of how to do things for future reference without worrying about it going live.
The reason it doesn't show is because the folder is marked as excluded in the `_config.yml` - but overwritten in `_config_staging.yml` to include it anyway.
