The [Science Analytics and Synthesis Program (SAS)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) manages the U.S. Node to GBIF, GBIF-US, to facilitate access to species occurrence data (presence and absence), analyses and investigations of species trends, drivers of change, and potential implications of future changes in biodiversity in the United States and U.S. Territories. This pilot implementation of a Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) national data portal serves as an access point to U.S. species occurrence data contributed to GBIF. The Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) project provided the foundation for the current implementation of GBIF-US.  

Occurrence data are a type of observational data that are records of an organism at a particular time in a particular place, and serve as a primary or ancillary function of many biological field investigations. These data often reside in numerous distributed systems and formats (including publications) and are consequently not being used to their full potential. USGS SAS accomplishes its mission of mobilizing biodiversity information for the U.S. and U.S. Territories by providing bioinformatic tools, data and models for researchers, government decision-makers and other stakeholders. In addition to this national portal, USGS SAS also hosts an [Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) instance](https://bison.usgs.gov/ipt) as part of that mission and the U.S. contribution to GBIF. USGS SAS will continue to leverage the accumulated human and infrastructural resources of the long-term USGS investment in research and information management and delivery.
