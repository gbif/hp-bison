## BISON

The Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) project maintains a suite of web-based, species data and information resources managed by the [Science Analytics and Synthesis Program (SAS)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to facilitate access to species occurrence data (presence and absence), analyses and investigations of species trends, drivers of change, and potential implications of future changes in biodiversity in the United States and U.S. Territories. As part of the BISON projectâ€™s suite of resources, this pilot implementation of a Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) national data portal serves as an access point to U.S. species occurrence data contributed to the GBIF data portal.  

Researchers collect species occurrence data, records of an organism at a particular time in a particular place, as a primary or ancillary function of many biological field investigations. These data often reside in numerous distributed systems and formats (including publications) and are consequently not being used to their full potential. USGS SAS accomplishes its mission of mobilizing biodiversity information for the U.S. and U.S. Territories by providing bioinformatic tools, data and models for researchers, government decision-makers and other stakeholders. As part of that mission and U.S. contribution to GBIF, in addition to this national portal, USGS SAS also hosts the [BISON species mapping application](https://bison.usgs.gov/) and the [BISON Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) instance](https://bison.usgs.gov/ipt) as part of the U.S. contribution to GBIF. USGS SAS will continue to leverage the accumulated human and infrastructural resources of the long-term USGS investment in research and information management and delivery.
